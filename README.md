<h2>Project Overview</h2>

We aim to create a centralized database for projects announced by Prime Minister Carney under review by the new Major Projects Office.
Our aim is to track the current status, budget, location of project to aid the Major Projects Office in project management.  This will allow search and filtering options to quickly access the data needed. Our DataBase has been populated by all Nation Building Projects as annonced by Prime Minister Carney

Our tables include; Projects, Provinces, Contractors, Tenders. This allows tracking of any project with the ability to highlight any relevant information such as budgets, province, contractors ect. Our Tender table is used to primarily tie the database together.   This is best demoonstrated using the ERD.

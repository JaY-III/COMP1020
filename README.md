1.0 Project Overview (A brief, 1-2 paragraph summary of the project. Reiterate the problem you are solving for the ICC and briefly describe your solution.)

The overall scope of the project is to provide SQL Database back end to track the projects annonced by Prime Minister Carney under review by the new Major Projects Office


Our projects aim is to provide a database to allow tracking of 

2.0 Database Design (A short paragraph explaining your database schema. Mention the key tables you designed (Projects, Contractors, etc.) and briefly explain why you chose the relationships between them (e.g., "We used a junction table, ProjectAssignments, to resolve the many-to-many relationship between Projects and Contractors."))

3.0 Setup and Execution Instructions (A clear, numbered, step-by-step guide to run your project.)

1. Prerequisites: List any software needed (e.g., "MySQL Workbench must be installed.").

2. Database Creation: Explain how to create the database (e.g., "Open the provided [your_project_name].sql file in MySQL Workbench.").

3. Run the Script: Explain how to execute the script (e.g., "Execute the entire script by clicking the 'lightning bolt' icon to create all tables and insert all sample data.").

4. Verification: Provide a simple query the user can run to confirm everything worked (e.g., "To verify a successful setup, you can run SELECT * FROM Projects; and you should see 10 sample projects.").

4.0 Project Scope (Clearly define the boundaries of your proof-of-concept.)

· In Scope: Briefly list what your project accomplishes (e.g., "Tracks projects, contractors, and their assignments," "Provides 5 key queries for reporting.").

· Out of Scope: List features that are not included (e.g., "Does not include a user login system," "Does not track project budgets at a granular level.").

· Assumptions: List any assumptions you made (e.g., "Assumes a contractor can work in multiple provinces.").
